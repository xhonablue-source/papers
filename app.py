            This paper examines how information networks and digital connectivity affect moral responsibility in contemporary global society. Drawing on empirical research in moral psychology, network theory, and media studies, we analyze how awareness of distant suffering through digital media creates new forms of moral obligation that challenge traditional proximity-based ethical frameworks. We propose the **Information-Mediated Responsibility (IMR) model**, which accounts for how technological mediation affects moral salience, emotional engagement, and behavioral response.

            Key findings include: (1) digital information exposure creates measurable changes in moral judgment patterns, (2) network effects amplify individual moral responses through social reinforcement mechanisms, and (3) information overload can paradoxically reduce moral responsiveness through psychological defense mechanisms. We conclude with practical recommendations for ethical engagement in digital environments and educational approaches for developing critical moral literacy in an interconnected world.

        The digital revolution has fundamentally altered the landscape of moral responsibility. Unlike previous generations, who remained largely unaware of distant suffering, contemporary individuals receive constant streams of information about global injustices, environmental crises, and human rights violations. This unprecedented access to information about suffering raises profound questions about the scope and nature of moral obligation.

        st.write("""
        Traditional ethical frameworks developed under assumptions of limited information and local communities. Utilitarian calculations assumed practical constraints on knowledge and action. Virtue ethics focused on character development within particular communities. Deontological systems emphasized universal principles but were applied within contexts of limited awareness. None adequately address the moral implications of instantaneous global information access.
